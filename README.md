# ABB IRB5500 Matlab Simulation

This project contains the model and the simulation of ABB IRB5500 robot.
Videos on my YouTube channel here:

## 1. IRB5500.m : 
Robot code definition, it contains the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.

## 2. Pickandplace_demo.m : 
This program simulates a pick and place example.

## 2. Recta_demo.m : 
This program simulates the robot following a default straight line trayectory.

### 2.1 Recta_demo_v2.m
 This program simulates the robot following a straight line trayectory. The line is defined by the user.

## 3. Inversa_demo.m : 
This program shows all the configuration of inverse kinematic for a fixed point.
